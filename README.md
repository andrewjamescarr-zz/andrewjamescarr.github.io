A user guide for Andrew Carr.  I offer this to you because the faster we get to know each other and how we work, the better and stronger our relationship will be, and the more we can accomplish together.

If you have your own User Guide, please share it with me so I can learn how best to work with you.

## How we should work together

### Communication

* My preferred hierarchy of communication (least → most urgent): Email → Teams → WhatsApp → Phone Call.
* I prefer email to be used when detailed information and data needs to be shared.  I find emails must easier when retreival is required at a later date.
* Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time.
* I don't expect a response to anything in real-time. If it's urgent, the hierarchy of communication should change.
* If we find ourselves in an almost real-time conversation on email or Teams, or if takes more than 2-3 messages to bring closure to a topic, then I may suggested we move to voice/video.
* I mostly prefer long-form writing using collaboration tools such as Confluence.
* Don't expect an answer if you just write "Hello" in Microsoft Teams chat. Phrase your message that allows me to provide a meaningful response as soon as I've read and had time to answer.  Find our more at [https://NoHello.net](https://nohello.net/en) or [https://aka.ms/nohello](https://aka.ms/nohello)
* I have a direct communication style.  I say what I mean.  I'll be explicit and unambiguous.
* I am clearer in writing than in person. In person, I may talk my thoughts out loud which can feel rambling; you'll get to see my mind at work -- good luck ;)

#### Email
* I read all of them.  I only reply if absolutely necessary.  _Note: I've not figured out all my rules for replying, Hufffington Post has pretty good [article](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/when-stop-replying-email_l_619bfd74e4b0f398af09184e)_ 
* 'CC' me on email when it's only for information.  I filter out CC emails into another folder.  I'll read them less often than those sent TO me.  
* Use the [@mentions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-mentions-to-get-someone-s-attention-90701709-5dc1-41c7-aa48-b01d4a46e8c7) feature if you want to highlight an action.
* Emails written with the [Bottom Line Up Front](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deliver-bottom-line-up-front-andrew-james-carr/ "Deliver the Bottom Line Up Front") are great:
  * Actions and due dates at the top
  * Conclusion first, main points, then facts and data to support the conclusion

### How I like to work
* I want to spend as much time in Level 1 of [The Pyramid of Communication](https://nozbe.com/blog/communication-pyramid/):
  * Level 1: Deep work
  * Level 2: Feedback loops
  * Level 3: Direct messaging
  * Level 4: Immediate feedback / talking to each other
  * Level 5: Meetings
* I really dislike context switching. My decision making abilities will suffer.  My technqiues to avoid:
  * 15 minute gaps between short(er) meetings → it provides me time to reflect / decompress.
  * Task batching: Grouping and performing similar tasks together.
  * Time blocking: Dividing my day into blocks, such as 'meetings', 'email', and 'deep work'. I'll block out time in my calendar.
  * [Pomodoro Technique](https://pomofocus.io/)
* I need time and space to reflect, especially on problems or decisions.  I need time to formulate a well-framed rationale for why I think what I think.  Or I need a framework in mind when working through something.
* I minimise distractions as much as possible; in practice, this means:
  * Email notifications are always _turned off_
  * Microsoft Teams will be set to _Do Not Disturb_ when I'm in 'deep work'

### Logistics
* I prefer to work during pre-defined 'core hours' (9am - 5pm); but where I have to manage a healthy work/life balance (childcare, children's sports days, running errands), then these times may change slightly. (Refer to my calendar rules).
* I will adapt to early morning or late evening phone calls when working with with geographically dispersed teams;  I'll take the time back later.
* Please respect my personal space boundaries. Evenings and weekends I'm with my family.
* Tell me about your personal space boundaries.  I will always respect them.  We can mutually agree if we need to break this rule for short periods.
* My calendar rules
  * It'll always be up to date
  * I'll accept meetings I can attend, and decline those I can't.  I'll avoid "tentative" accepts - that helps neither of us
  * I'll avoid back to back meetings.  We all need a comfort break, right?
  * Every meeting invite will have a clear objective/outcome;  I use _nouns_ rather than _verb statements_: "agreement on...", "answers to..."
  * My working location will always be shown (i.e. home office, campus office)
  * My calendar is open and accessible so everyone can see my availability. Please don't ask for a meeting, and then wait for me to arrange; just book the meeting. I don't mind people booking things in my calendar if I am free
* Meeting actions and minutes should be taken collaboratively in real time; follow ups days after the event mean context or actions are mis-remembered.  No one person should be "holding the pen"

### 1:1s
* We'll maintain a working document for us to collaborate one (i.e Teams Notes, Confluence, Wiki, Sharepoint document)
* 1:1s are for you.  You can dictate the agenda as you see fit; we can discuss concerns you have, profesional development, where you have issues
* 1:1s are not for 'project updates'.  We have other places/times for that

### Known Defects

| Defect      | Workaround  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Migraine**:  High levels of stress, excessive tiredness, lack of regular eating/drinking habits contribute to onset of migraine. Early outwardly recognisable symptons: (1) Inability to concentrate on seemingly simple tasks (2) Emesis (in extreme cases where workarounds are not present) | Sleep. Preferably in a dark room.  Early access to Coffee, Painkillers, Sumatriptan.|
| **Context assumption**:  I sometimes assume everyone has the same context as I do. If that happens, I might not communicate the context or my perspective as clearly as I should.| Please remind me to provide more context if I do this. |

### TODO
* I don't like surprises
* Names are our identity
* My humour (or lack of, according to my 9yr old)
* Accountabilities / resonsibilities -- in a new role?
